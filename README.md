What is it
----------

Oh, nothing special but thanks for asking. Basically it is just a tiny hack to
solve a problem of mine. For my lectures I wanted to be able to put tutorials
online without much effort. Tiny manuals or documentation pages with a clean
and beautiful look and a possibility to browse between chapters. This is,
instead of simply showing a long HTML page, it should be possible to only show
one chapter at a time and read through them like a book.

So here it is. The result of one evening of coding. A minimal single page
app which allows to easily build beautiful HTML tutorials. No feature bloat
and no external dependencies. Just one VanillaJS class and a stylesheet.
And it doesn't get in your way, except for the stylesheet which applies global
styling to your document.
